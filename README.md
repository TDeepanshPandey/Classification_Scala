# Classification using Logistic Regression (Scala)

I have implemented a logistic regression model on titanic dataset which have various column like Name, sex, age, ticket, fare and whether that passenger survived or not. The dataset is divided into test and training set. Model is trained on training data and validated with test data. The performance is shown using confusion matrix.
